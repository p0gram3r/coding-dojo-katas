# Kata 6 - Code refactoring

Code refactoring is a "disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior",[1] undertaken in order to improve some of the nonfunctional attributes of the software. Advantages include improved code readability and reduced complexity to improve the maintainability of the source code, as well as a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)

## Goal

The goal of this kata is to train the process of refactoring unknown code. 

The code examples in this kata contain a lot of things that you would usually not want to do in productive 
code. This is intentional for the sake of training!
